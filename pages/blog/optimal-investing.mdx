I'm a recovering mutual fund investor. Not that I ever thought that mutual funds
were a good idea—I just didn't think about it. But now I've done just the
slightest bit of research and found out how to save at least hundreds of
thousands of dollars in opportunity cost over the coming decades.

<P>
  <InlineFootnote note="Maybe not a bad place to buy life insurance—I have no idea.">
    My dad referred me to [Edward Jones](https://www.edwardjones.com/) my first
    year out of college to buy life insurance.
  </InlineFootnote>{" "}
  Then they convinced my wife and me to open a couple of IRAs with them. I have
  to mention first that I'm glad they did, because that was way better than what
  I was doing at the time, which was _not investing_ (other than in [my
  employer's retirement plan](https://www.tsp.gov/), which I'd given little
  thought to). But now that I'm actually looking at other options four years
  later, I'm finding it's far from the best.
</P>

<P>
  I'm kicking myself for not asking at the beginning the now-obvious question of
  how Edward Jones makes money when I invest, but oh well. [You don't know what
  you don't know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence),
  right? Betterment was kind enough to point me to the answer the other day,
  though, when I experimented a bit with [their external account syncing
  feature](https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/product-news/4-reasons-to-sync-your-accounts-with-betterment/).
  In my neglect to scour our IRAs' fine print,{" "}
  <InlineFootnote note="And I'm not sure whether or not that 5.75% front load fee applies to me, which would be rather significant in its own right, but we'll just focus on that expense ratio.">
    I missed the part about this fund's [1.12% expense
    ratio](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3AMAAGX), essentially the
    yearly fee on all our holdings.
  </InlineFootnote>
</P>

Now 1.12% doesn't sound like a huge loss at face value, but that's money that
you can't keep in your investment portfolio to earn a lifetime of compound
interest, so it can add up to quite a bit. Trent Hamm of
[The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/) wrote
[a fantastic thought experiment](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-fees-matter/)
that illustrates this perfectly.

You can read the article for more details, but here's the summary. After 40
years under this same scenario, here's how three different investments fare, the
only difference between them being the annual management fee:

### Example 1

- Annual fee: 0.05%
- Investment value after 40 years: $1,057,904.60
- Total cost of fees: $15,143.25

### Example 2

- Annual fee: 0.3%
- Investment value after 40 years: $985,600.07
- Total cost of fees: $87,447.78

### Example 3

- Annual fee: 1%
- Investment value after 40 years: $810,415.39
- Total cost of fees: $262,632.46

For comparison, without any fee, the investment would have been worth
$1,073,047.85 at the end. So a 0.05% annual fee ends up costing 1.4% of your
40-year investment potential, a 0.3% fee costs 8.1% of your investment
potential, and a 1% annual fee ends up costing you a whopping **24.5%** over 40
years. Ouch. Needless to say, I'll be moving my IRAs elsewhere in the very near
future.

So should I seek to _eliminate_ fees, then, and buy individual stocks with a
free trader like [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com)? At that point you're
swinging the proverbial pendulum too far in the other
direction—[you](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/you-cant-beat-the-market-so-stop-trying/)
[can't](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/beating-the-market.asp)
[beat](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/almost-no-one-can-beat-the-market-2013-10-25)
[the](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/)
[market](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-dont-professional-investors-beat-the-market/).
If the majority of professionals—folks who spend their entire lives in the stock
market—can't do it, I don't think I have much chance.

So now we have _two_ dimensions to optimize: management fees and investor
stupidity, er, volatility. The way to do that is by buying ALL THE STOCKS using
low-cost index funds, and the gold standard in that arena is
[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/why-vanguard). Their
[Total Stock Market ETF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0970&FundIntExt=INT),
for instance, has an expense ratio of 0.04%. Not too shabby.

Throw everything in VTI, then? Many a wise financial guru has advised the same,
and it's an immense improvement over my current situation. But I found one more
dimension to optimize, and I'm determined to eke every bit of performance I can
out of my automated investment game. That third dimension: taxes.

"Tax loss harvesting" is a term I first heard in podcast advertisements for
popular "robo-advisors" [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) and
[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/). Here's
[Betterment's description](https://www.betterment.com/tax-loss-harvesting/) of
the concept:

<Blockquote>
  Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced
  a loss. By realizing, or "harvesting" a loss,{" "}
  <InlineFootnote
    note={
      "If you hear this and can't help but ask, \"Doesn't tax-loss harvesting just defer tax liability?\", [Wealthfront has addressed that question](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/209348546-Doesn-t-tax-loss-harvesting-just-defer-tax-liability-) as well."
    }
  >
    investors are able to offset taxes
  </InlineFootnote>{" "}
  on both gains and income. The sold security is replaced by a similar one,
  maintaining the optimal asset allocation and expected returns.
</Blockquote>

<P>
  Wealthfront figures [their Tax-Loss
  Harvesting](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/209348486) would
  have increased after-tax returns by over 1.55% per year between 2000 and 2011.
  Betterment quotes an increase of 0.77% over 2000–2013 for [their Tax Loss
  Harvesting+](https://www.betterment.com/tax-loss-harvesting/). And in case
  these theoretical calculations aren't convincing enough, everyone's favorite
  mustachioed early retirement guru has seen Betterment's feature [increasing
  his
  returns](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/02/01/betterment-cranks-up-features-and-costs-is-it-still-worthwhile/)

  enough to offset{" "}
  <InlineFootnote note="Keep in mind that this management fee sits on top of the expense ratios of the individual funds you'll buy through them (which are mostly Vanguard in both cases anyway).">
    their management fees, which are each essentially 0.25% per year,
  </InlineFootnote>{" "}
  with a few subtle differences I'll detail below.
</P>

So now it's time to decide between the two giants in this narrowed field. They
do largely the same thing, but each has a few unique strengths that the other
doesn't share. Fees and feature sets of both players have evolved several times
over the past few years, but as of July 2017, here's how things stand.

### Betterment's strengths

- **No minimum balance**.
- **Up to 1 year of free management on new accounts**,
  [depending on your initial deposit amount](https://www.betterment.com/pricing/).
- **No fee on additional investments above $2 million**.
- **Goal-based investing**. Beyond just generic investment portfolios with
  static stock allocations, Betterment also offers
  [custom portfolios to facilitate various savings goals](https://www.betterment.com/resources/research/goals-advice-explained/)
  (because
  [savings accounts are dumb](https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/goals-and-advice/short-term-investing-savings-account-alternative/)).
  Such portfolios automatically lower their risk level (i.e., stock allocation)
  over time as the savings timeline closes.
- **Fractional shares**. In order not to leave any idle cash in your account
  uninvested, Betterment allows customers to
  [own fractions of ETF shares](https://www.betterment.com/resources/investment-strategy/fractional-shares-diversification-portfolio-investing/),
  down to one millionth of a share, in fact.
- **SmartDeposit**. Instead of a normal auto-deposit, where you automatically
  deposit the same amount of money each week/month from your checking account,
  [you can tell Betterment the maximum amount of money you want in the bank at any given time](https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/product-news/smartdeposit-auto-deposit-but-smarter/),
  and then at least once a week it will monitor your checking account for excess
  cash above that amount and deposit it into your investment account.
- **A
  [Socially Responsible Investing Portfolio](https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/product-news/socially-responsible-investing-portfolio/)
  option**, which "reduces exposure to companies that are deemed to have a
  negative social impact—e.g., companies that profit from poor labor standards
  or environmental devastation—while increasing exposure to companies that are
  deemed to have a positive social impact—e.g., companies that foster inclusive
  workplaces or commit to environmentally sustainable practices."
- [**Referral bonuses**](https://www.betterment.com/referral/) of 30 days free
  management for each friend who funds a new account, plus an extra free year
  after your first three referrals.

### Wealthfront's strengths

- **No management fee on your first $10,000** (or your first $15,000 when
  [referred by a friend](https://wlth.fr/2w8a0vJ)).
  <LI>
    **Direct indexing**. On accounts over $100,000, Wealthfront will replace the
    total U.S. stock market ETF in your portfolio with{" "}
    <InlineFootnote note="Up to 100, 500, and 1,000 individual stocks for accounts over [$100,000](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/211005023-What-is-Direct-Indexing-), [$500,000, and $1 million](https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/advanced-indexing/), respectively.">
      a number of individual stocks
    </InlineFootnote>{" "}
    along with an ETF of much smaller companies, which both reduces your fund
    expense ratios and further increases opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.
    They estimate this to [increase tax-loss harvesting benefits to at least
    2.03%](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/211005023-What-is-Direct-Indexing-).
  </LI>
- [**Support for 529 College Savings Plans**](https://www.wealthfront.com/529). -
  [**Portfolio Line of Credit**](https://www.wealthfront.com/portfolio-line-of-credit).
- [**Referral bonuses**](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/209353126-Referrals-What-s-the-Wealthfront-Invite-Program-)
  of waived management fees on an additional $5,000 for each friend who funds a
  new account.

## The verdict

It's a close call. You can't really go wrong with either option, but if you must
have the absolute best, here are the questions you need to ask yourself.

Is having a socially responsible investment portfolio (at least
[as Betterment defines it](https://www.betterment.com/resources/research/socially-responsible-investing-portfolio/#SRIdefined))
important to you? If so, that makes your decision much easier: Betterment's your
only option right now. At least in the robo-arena.

Would a 529 College Savings Plan be useful to you? That tips your scale in
Wealthfront's favor.

Do you have trouble saving for large purchases? If Betterment's goal-based
investing approach would be a significant help for you, then by all means, you
can seal the deal on that point. I think I can duplicate that functionality well
enough on my own if need be, though.

If none of those three standout features apply, then it's just a numbers game.
Do you have less than $500 to invest? Then Wealthfront's $500 minimum deflects
you to Betterment.

Above the $500 line, it's a bit more murky, as you have to evaluate the
trade-off between Wealthfront's lack of fees on your first $15,000 and
Betterment's fractional shares. So let's do some rough math.

Without the benefit of fractional shares, a Wealthfront account will at any time
hold a cash balance between $0 and the value of one full ETF share. "ETFs trade
in increments of approximately $30 to $100", according to
[one of their help articles](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/211004143-Why-do-I-have-a-cash-balance-),
so to make things easy, let's say those shares average $65 (the midpoint of $30
and $100). Thus the average cash balance in your Wealthfront account at any
given time ought to be around $32.50 (half of $65).

On the other hand, once you reach $13,000 in your Betterment account, you'll
have a $32.50 annual management fee, which you wouldn't have at Wealthfront. I
know that the trade-off is more complex than that, but the point is, at some low
number (in investing terms), Wealthfront's fee structure mitigates their lack of
fractional shares. If you think it'll be a while till your portfolio makes it to
$13,000 or so, maybe start with Betterment so your investments can be more
diversified, but beyond that, start looking toward Wealthfront.

With account balances under $100,000, the comparison may be a bit of a wash, but
once you hit $100,000, Wealthfront's direct indexing kicks in, which looks to be
a decisive advantage. If you're high-rolling enough to have more than $2 million
in your nest egg, Betterment's then-decreasing management fee comes into play,
but since Wealthfront's direct indexing advantage seems worth more than 0.25%
per year at the least, I think I'd still stick with Wealthfront above $2
million, too.

So personally, I'm going to go with Wealthfront. I'm not at that $100,000 mark
yet, but it shouldn't take _too_ much longer to get there, and now I'll be ready
to reap those sweet direct indexing benefits from day one.

## Should you move your existing investments to a robo-advisor?

I've got the benefit of being pretty near the beginning of my investing journey
— IRAs are quite easy to roll over, and it looks like the few ETFs I hold now
should transfer directly to Wealthfront without having to sell. But what if
you've already been in this investing game for a while?

As mentioned, IRAs are easy. Both Wealthfront and Betterment allow for direct
transfers with no tax implications. Old employer-sponsored retirement plans
(401k, 403b, etc.) can be rolled into an IRA as well.

As for taxable investments, both services allow transfers via the Automated
Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS), but there are a few catches.
Betterment _only_ accepts transfers of
[compatible ETFs](https://support.betterment.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2463086-can-i-transfer-my-shares-from-an-outside-brokerage-to-betterment-?b_id=9042).
Wealthfront will accept all securities transferred to them, incorporating all
[compatible ETFs](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/210999343-What-ETFs-does-Wealthfront-use-to-implement-tax-loss-harvesting-)
and large-cap stocks directly into your Wealthfront investment mix, but they
will then
[sell any incompatible assets for you in a tax-minimized way](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/209348146-Can-I-transfer-my-outside-account-into-Wealthfront-).

Is it worth liquidating incompatible investments to fund a new portfolio? That
depends on a variety of factors, including your investment time frame. I'd
recommend playing around with
[Betterment's Switching Cost Calculator](https://www.betterment.com/resources/investment-strategy/taxes/investment-switching-costs-calculate-your-costs-and-benefits/)
to inform your decision. And even if you do keep some old investments where they
are, it's probably still worth putting any new investment capital into a
Wealthfront or Betterment portfolio instead of continuing to fund an old one.

So does Wealthfront sound best for you, too? If you sign up with
[my referral link](https://wlth.fr/2w8a0vJ) you'll get that extra $5,000 managed
for free. 😁

Are the socially responsible or goal-based investing options of Betterment more
up your alley? If so, thanks to some brief Betterment experimentation, I do have
[a referral link](https://www.betterment.com/invite/tylermick) you can use to
get an extra 90 days of free management, even though the referral won't benefit
me anymore. 👍🏼

Have fun, and keep growing that nest egg!
