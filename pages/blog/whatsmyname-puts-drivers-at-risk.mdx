The tragic
[death of Samantha Josephson](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/30/us/south-carolina-missing-college-student/index.html)
on March 29, 2019, is extremely heart-wrenching and was _not at all_ her fault.
[Her parents' mission](https://www.whatsmyname.org/) to educate the world on
rideshare safety in her memory is noble and absolutely worth pursuing. But
unfortunately, their central recommendation and social media campaign of asking
your driver "What's my name?" when you get in the car is the exact opposite of
what you should do and in fact puts rideshare drivers at risk.

Uber and Lyft have long provided the following four key pieces of information to
identify your driver:

1. The make, model, and color of their vehicle
2. Their license plate number
3. A photo of your driver
4. Your driver's name

Put these together and you know you're getting in the right car with the right
person. Still, though, it doesn't hurt to be extra careful, right? Asking your
driver what _your_ name is would be fine except for one thing: a passenger's
name is the _only_ piece of information a driver has to be sure they've picked
up the right person.

Over the past two and a half years I've now given 3,024 rides across the Uber
and Lyft platforms, so, needless to say, I've got my beginning-of-ride script
down to a science. I always hope that my passengers check my license plate first
before opening the door, but it seems like most just look for the black and pink
stickers on my windshield and hop right in. For that reason (and also because
it's polite), I introduce myself immediately as soon as a passenger starts
climbing in.

> "Hi, I'm Ty!"

Oftentimes my passenger responds in kind with their own name, but if not I ask
for it. Only when I get a name that matches the name on my driver app (which
sometimes involves a "Oh, my friend Carlos ordered this ride for me!") do I
start the trip, because about once every twenty or thirty times _the wrong
person is in my car_.

Nearly always this is an honest mistake, a legitimate Uber or Lyft customer who
simply hadn't realized their error. I know I've accidentally given the wrong
person a ride at least once in my early days, and I don't want to repeat the
blunder. But the honest mistake is not the one I'm worried about.

Say you want to steal an Uber ride. You see me pull up nearby, turn on my hazard
lights, and expertly parallel park. I'm obviously waiting for a passenger. You
slyly sidle on up, make like you're looking at an Uber app on your phone, open
my back door, and ask me, "#WhatsMyName?" If I give you a name that sounds like
it could match your gender and ethnicity, you respond "Correct!" and jump in,
and I feel good for making you feel safe. If the name doesn't sound like it
could be yours, you respond "Yep! My buddy ordered the ride for me." Then after
I start driving, you look at your phone and say, "Ope, looks like my friends are
changing their mind again. Could you change my destination to MacLaren's Pub
instead?"

I suspect that this happened to me once. Not exactly like this, as it was before
the advent of #WhatsMyName—I just wasn't judicious enough about verifying the
identity of my passenger. So particularly because I give my own name right away
when someone opens my door, I can't give up the name of my passenger, or I open
myself up to ride thieves. Or worse. It's not fun to talk about, but that's the
subject at hand, and
[Uber drivers have been targeted](https://www.google.com/search?q=uber+driver+killed)
in the past, too.

When someone does ask "What's my name?", which has happened approximately five
times so far, I've determined that the best response is "I'm sorry, I have to
hear that from you. But _your_ app does say that my name is Ty and that I'm
driving a red Prius with license plate number…"

---

Fixing #WhatsMyName is easy. After verifying the make, model, color, and license
plate of your driver's car and checking that the driver's face matches the photo
in your app, if your driver doesn't immediately give their name when you open
the door, just flip the script and ask, "What's _your_ name?" If that name
matches the one in your app, then be assured that you're entering the right car!
And if you feel like it,
[share the status of your Uber ride](https://www.uber.com/ride/how-uber-works/share-status/)
or [your Lyft ride](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/shareroute) with your friends so
they know when to expect you and what vehicle you'll be arriving in.

I'm going to contact the
[What's My Name Foundation](https://www.whatsmyname.org/) to ask if they'd have
the courage to change their name and their social media campaign in order to
promote rideshare safety for both riders _and_ drivers instead of accidentally
promoting rideshare safety for riders at the expense of drivers. All of their
acronym still applies: **S**top, **A**sk, **M**atch, **I**nform.
[Remember Sami](https://www.whatsmyname.org/#comp-jvejc3r3). Her death was not
her fault.

And remember: check the car, check the photo, then ask
"[#WhatsYourName](https://clicktotweet.com/63eea)?"
