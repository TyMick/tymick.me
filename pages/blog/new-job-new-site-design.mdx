I got a full-time job! Full-stack software developer at [Faithlife][f]—just
finished my second week. Anyway, now that no longer have to sell myself as
either a freelancer or a job applicant, I figured I can adjust this site to
focus more on my writing.

What will I write about? We'll find out. My posts have been pretty code-focused
lately, but that was mostly to serve a marketing purpose. I plan to branch out
more in the future.

The design's definitely a work in progress. I'd love to improve the typography,
for starters (I'm very inspired by [Butterick’s Practical Typography][pt] on
that front). Maybe add a dark color theme as well (which Butterick is [not fond
of][newsletter], ironically).

But all in good time. This post is mainly just an acknowledgement that Things
Have Changed here.

Explicit wrapper export shouldn't be necessary, but when using MDX files as
Next.js pages, the [wrapper component][1] doesn't receive [`layoutProps`][2] as
it should. Perhaps this will be fixed in future versions of MDX and/or
@next/mdx?
