Dear Representatives (especially my representative, [Rick Larsen][0]),

I urge you to vote No on the Sunshine Protection Act that the Senate just
approved yesterday. Switching clocks twice a year is bad, but permanent Daylight
Saving Time (DST) would be a move in the wrong direction for human health.

The science is very clear on this when comparing populations living in permanent
DST with populations living in permanent Standard Time (ST), and even when
comparing people living on the western versus eastern edges of time zones.
[Study upon study][1] demonstrate the negative effects of later sunlight on
physical and mental health, including cancer, heart disease, depression,
diabetes, obesity, decreased life expectancy, and shorter sleep. And numerous
scientific societies oppose permanent DST, including the [Society for Research
on Biological Rhythms][2] (which represents over 1,000 scientists in the United
States and worldwide), the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine][3], the
[European Biological Rhythms Society][4], and the [Daylight Academy][5].

Advocates of permanent DST often point out associations between later sunsets
and increased exercise. Exercise is good, but it is a tool, not an outcome. The
outcome that matters is health, and according to the above wealth of studies,
any marginal increase in exercise that accompanies later sunlight is not enough
to improve any of those suffering health metrics.

And the risks are economic as well. Lack of sleep is already [costing 2% of our
gross domestic product][6]â€”let's not increase that cost even further.

Please vote No on the Sunshine Protection Act and instead support measures to
move the United States to permanent Standard Time.
