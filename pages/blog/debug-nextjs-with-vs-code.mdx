Debugging Next.js is hard. Their documentation includes a [Debugging][1] page,
but [as of this writing][2], it only covers debugging server-side code. The
worst part, though, is that it doesn't _say_ it only works for server-side code,
which caused me a good deal of frustration (and nearly tears) wondering why none
of my breakpoints were working. My current project, as it happens, is completely
[statically generated][3] so far, so _all_ of my code is client-side.

There's been an [open issue][4] in the Next.js repo for over a year now on this
subject. That led me in the right direction, at least: to some relatively new
magic in VS Code's [built-in JavaScript debugger][5] and a closer look at the
editor's [debugging docs][6]. After all this investigation, I've come up with a
few launch configurations that have solved all my Next.js debugging problems,
letting me debug just the front end, just the back end, or both at the same
time, right in the comfort of VS Code. I hope they can help you too!

To get started, create a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your
project with the following content:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "next dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug client-side",
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug full stack",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "next dev",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "pattern": "started server on .+, url: (https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "action": "debugWithChrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you're using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start your dev server, replace
both instances of `next dev` above with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`, whichever
you're using. If you're [changing the port number][7] your application starts
on, replace the `3000` in `http://localhost:3000` with the port you're using
instead.

Now go to the Debug panel (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> on
Windows/Linux, <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> on macOS), select a launch
configuration, then press <kbd>F5</kbd> or select <samp>Debug: Start
Debugging</samp> from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.
Voil√†!

I've opened a [Next.js documentation PR][8] with these improvements, so
hopefully their debugging page won't be out of date for too much longer. ü§ûüèº
**Update:** The PR has merged! Now I'll see about adding these launch configs to
[`create-next-app`][9].

<!--
Explicit wrapper export shouldn't be necessary, but when using MDX files as
Next.js pages, the [wrapper component][1] doesn't receive [`layoutProps`][2] as
it should. Perhaps this will be fixed in future versions of MDX and/or
@next/mdx?
