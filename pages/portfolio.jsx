        I don&rsquo;t consider myself a designer, but I definitely know whether
        or not I like a given design. Maybe that&rsquo;s what makes one a
        designer? In any case, I&rsquo;ve gotten to know my way around{" "}
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> pretty well by now, so
        I can definitely make something functional and attractive.

        That being said, that&rsquo;s not the fun part. The <em>fun</em> part is
        the <em>logic</em>, the <em>behind-the-scenes</em>, the stuff you
        don&rsquo;t notice until something&rsquo;s going wrong. That&rsquo;s
        where the excitement&rsquo;s at, and where I prefer to spend my time.
